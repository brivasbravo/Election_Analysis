## Election Audit Summary 

The code developed to run this analysis is a great and efficient tool for the election commission to analyze data sets of big scales, like this audit, the code is extremely customizable and can be easily run to analyze any data set by making small adjustments. The script can be applied to any electoral tabular dataset simply by changing the source of the data on the code itself, as can be seen in the screenshot below.

As can be seen in the following image, it's very easy to manipulate the script to be run for any sort of election, be it a congressional or even a federal election, as it was designed to pull the candidates from the dataset itself. On the second screenshot, it can also be referenced how the input for the county could be switched to a city, or even a state and the code can be easily modified to gather this data on its own as opposed to being manually entered shows how flexible and usable this code can be for the commission.
